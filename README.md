This package is meant to package the minimal requirements to invoke the Amplify GraphQL transformer.
The schema used is a simple `Todo` model that we intend to test against.

If you're consuming this via AWS Lambda dependency, execute the `executeGraphQLTransform` method that's exported from this package in your handler.
